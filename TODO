Dismissed TODO:
library.MonthlyCleanup: Consider also deleting event from GCal when event is being
                        deleted from datastore.
                        This was dismissed because it increases latency of the
                        operation, but will have little to no effect on the user
                        since the event is 3 months or more old.
