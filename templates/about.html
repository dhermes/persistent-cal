      <p>This is what I like to call a &quot;missing feature&quot; of Google
      Calendar. I was inspired</br>by the fact that my coworkers could not see
      my flights with the rest of</br>my work calendar. Rather than sharing my
      TripIt link with all my coworkers (even</br>those who I didn't know needed
      my travel plans), why not just import my TripIt into</br>my work calendar?
      But by using the &quot;Import Calendar&quot; option in Google</br>
      Calendar, it is only a static upload and updates won't persist. Enter
      <strong>persistant-cal</strong>!</p>
      <p>Silly change untweak.</p>
      <p>The following tries to cover some possible questions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You may only request up to four calendar feeds.</li>
        <li>
          Only calendar feeds from a predefined whitelist will be used. All
          other feeds you supply will be ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
          At this time, the whitelist is the following list of regular
          expressions:
          <ul>
            <li style="font-family:courier;">
            ^((http|https|webcal)://|)www.tripit.com/feed/ical/private/[A-Za-z0-9-]+/tripit.ics$
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Each event in your calendar(s) will be added to a private general
          purpose Google Calendar.
        </li>
        <li>
          You will be added as an attendee to the events specific to your feeds,
          but will not have edit privileges over the Google Calendar events.
        </li>
        <li>
          If another user has a feed with the exact same ID, they will also be
          added to the Google Calendar event.
        </li>
      </ul>
